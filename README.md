# @capire/orders

This is a sample app which provides a generic reuse service for managing orders,
and a corresponding Fiori UI. It is used in the [bookstore](../bookstore) sample.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is just a sample, not intended for production use. It is meant to demonstrate how to create a CAP plugin and how to use it in your application. It is not optimized for performance or security.

### Integrate

Instead of embedding it into your application, you can also run the app standalone,
and consume the service through OData.
